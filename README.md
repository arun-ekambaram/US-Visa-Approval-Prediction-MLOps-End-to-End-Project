## Overview
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the approval status of visa applications based on applicants' data. By leveraging multiple classification algorithms and hyperparameter tuning, this project aims to develop a robust predictive model.

## Dataset
- The dataset for this project is stored in a MongoDB database.
- It includes various features related to the applicant and visa application, including both numerical and categorical attributes.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, MongoDB, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM)
